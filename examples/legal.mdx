## Contract Clause Locator

The **Contract Clause Locator** is a smart AI assistant designed to navigate complex legal contracts. 

It uses a Memory Model to retrieve relevant clauses and a **"Time Machine" logic** to resolve conflicts between base contracts and subsequent amendments (addendums), ensuring the assistant always refers to the most up-to-date legal "truth".

### Key Features
- **Memory-Augmented Retrieval**: Search across multiple contract documents with high precision.
- **Time Machine Logic**: Automatically prioritizes the latest amendments based on effective dates.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles hierarchical overrides (e.g., specific section updates).
