description: "The Explorer is the primary interface to inspect, debug, and understand memory inside Memory Model. It is not a dashboard for metrics. It is a memory introspection tool — built to answer one question: What does my agent remember, and why?"

## What the Explorer is for

When you build long-living agents, memory becomes a system component. The Explorer exists to give you _control_ and _explainability_ over that component.

You use the Explorer to:

- inspect stored memories (nodes)
- understand how and when they were written
- see how relevance evolves over time
- debug retrieval behavior
- verify that isolation, scope, and policies are respected

If something looks wrong in your agent’s behavior, the Explorer is where you go first.

## Accessing the Explorer

To view and inspect memories:

1. Enter your **workspace**
2. Select the desired **cluster**
3. Navigate to the **Explorer** tab

This opens the Memory Explorer, the main interface for live memory inspection.

## Using the Explorer

### Filters panel (left sidebar)

On the left side of the Explorer you’ll find a set of filters that let you control **which memories are visualized**.

You can filter by:

- \*\*Content search - \*\*Free-text search inside memory content
- \*\*Time range - \*\*Restrict memories to a specific time window (or all time)
- \*\*Content type - \*\*Text memories - Vision memories (if enabled)
- \*\*Target user - \*\*All users, a specific user (to inspect isolated user memory)
- \*\*Source nodes - \*\*Choose which memory nodes to include as sources

These filters are applied before any data is loaded, giving you precise control over what you inspect.

### Scanning memories

Once your filters are set:

- Click **SCAN** in the top-right corner

When you press **SCAN**, the Explorer performs a live inspection of the memory layer using your selected filters.

You will then see a visual representation of the matching memories.

## Memory views

Once memories are loaded, you can change **how they are visualized** using the view selector in the top-right corner of the Explorer.

### Table view

By clicking on the **table view** icon, you can switch to a tabular representation of memories.

This view is designed for:

- inspecting **large volumes of memory**
- scanning and comparing records across users
- validating structured fields and schemas
- spotting inconsistencies, gaps, or anomalies at scale

In table view, each row represents a memory record, while columns map to the structured fields of the underlying memory nodes.

This makes it especially useful when working with production agents and high-throughput systems, where understanding memory at scale is critical.
